<h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application</h1>
<section><p>Dear Eileen<br>
    Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p></section>
    </main>
    <h2>Starting dates</h2>
<p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility — as long as the subjects fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'd like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
    <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at tempratures exceeding 30<sup>o</sup>C (86<sup>o</sup>F), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 × 103 > 3 × 104.)</li>
</ol>
